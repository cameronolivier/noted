# --- Option 1: If packages absolutely need their build scripts ---
# This is still a broad hammer for the project, but better than global.
# Only use if hoisting alone doesn't solve the "not built" issue for packages like sharp.

# --- Option 2: Targeted Hoisting (Usually the best first step for resolution issues) ---
# This helps tools find these packages if they struggle with pnpm's symlinks.

# You might also need to hoist dependencies of these if they are the root cause, e.g.:
# public-hoist-pattern[]=*esbuild* # Hoists anything containing esbuild in its path

# --- Option 3: If many packages cause issues (more aggressive hoisting) ---
# This makes your node_modules look more like npm/yarn classic. Use if targeted hoisting is too tedious.
